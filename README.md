# railway-timetable-conflict-detection-and-resolution
“This project models a real-world scheduling problem using object-oriented design. Conflicts are detected using interval overlap theory and represented implicitly as a conflict graph. Resolution is handled through a greedy, priority-based heuristic approach that minimizes delay and platform reassignment cost. The system applies constraint satisfaction and graph coloring principles without exhaustive search, making it efficient and scalable.”
